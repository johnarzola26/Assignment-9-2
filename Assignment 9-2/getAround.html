        <h1>Getting around Manila</h1>
        <p>
          "Metro Manila", or the agglomeration of the historic city of Manila
          plus Quezon City, Pasig, San Juan, Makati and thirteen other
          neighboring towns and cities, is a big, sprawling mess of modern
          skyscrapers, worn-down warehouses, stately houses and slums.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tourists tend to stay away from immersing themselves fully in Manila,
          preferring to jet off immediately to more pleasant Philippine spots
          like Boracay, Siargao and Bohol. (If you're one of them, you'll want
          to read our how-to for traveling to the Philippines while avoiding
          Manila, or our list of best beaches in the Philippines.)
        </p>
        <p>
          But skipping Manila means you skip out on an interesting experience.
          Even the much-warned-about transportation in Manila can be easy (at
          the very least, tolerable) if you follow a few simple rules of thumb.

        <h4>Riding Manila's LRT and MRT Railway Systems</h4>

        />
        <p>
          A single shuttle bus links NAIA Terminal 3 with the Pasay interchange
          (location on Google Maps) connecting Manila's two main light rail
          lines, the MRT and the LRT (further divided into lines 1 and 2).
          Riding the rails can be fun if you strictly avoid riding during
          weekday rush hours (7 am to 9 am; 5 pm to 9 pm), when each train car
          transforms into a seething mass of tightly packed people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fares cost between $0.25 and $0.50, stored in contactless magnetic
          cards that you place over turnstiles for easy access.

        <h4>Riding Buses and Jeepneys</h4>
        <p>
          Air-conditioned and regular non-aircon buses cover many major routes
          throughout Metro Manila and outward. These buses are mostly used by
          local commuters to get to and from work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fare for Manila buses cost between $0.20 and $1, depending on the
          distance of your trip; tickets are issued by "conductors" on the
          buses, whom you pay as they pass by on the bus aisle.
        </p>

          alt="image of people riding the jeepney"
        />
        <p>
          Point-to-point (P2P) buses traverse Manila's awful traffic to connect
          major malls and business districts. For many commuters, P2P buses
          represent the most comfortable way to get around Manila, though not
          the cheapest; fares range from around US$1.50 to US$3.50 in local
          currency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buses and jeepneys are hard to understand if you're a first time
          Manila visitor, but if you can hack them, these offer the cheapest way
          to get from point A to point B within Manila. To make sense of the
          transport situation, the website Sakay.ph ("sakay" means "to ride" in
          Filipino) allows travelers to input points A and B, upon which the
          website generates a route using the MRT/LRT, bus and jeepneys along
          the way.
