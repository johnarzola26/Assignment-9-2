        <h4>1.) Laguna Hot Springs Resort</h4>
        <p>
          Laguna has always been a popular weekend destination for locals
          because of its proximity to Manila. The province is rich with Laguna
          tourist spots such as historical places and monuments as well as
          natural attractions. Many travelers come to Laguna to experience its
          hot spring resorts. The province is home to several hot springs
          because of the geothermal heat and steam coming from Mount Makiling, a
          nearby volcano.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the natural hot springs in Laguna are found in the town of
          Calamba, Pansol, and Los Baños. They are ideal destinations for
          couples and big groups who are looking to relax from the busy urban
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the best Laguna hot spring resorts include Al Fresco Spring
          Resort, The Cliffhouse Laguna, Pansol Terraces, Villa Rina Hot
          Springs, and Arabella Spring Resort. These resorts offer naturally
          heated spring water as well as top-notch accommodation options and
          modern facilities.
